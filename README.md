# Overview

## Introduction

This project consists of two parts: 

1. A mathematical exploration of the history and math behind the Hamming Code (7, 4).
2. A program that simulates the process of encoding, correcting, and decoding as described by the Hamming Code.

To understand what the Hamming Code is, skip to the background section first to get an understanding of how the process is meant to work. Then, you can run the sample program to see it in action! 

## Setup



## Encoding

The sender.py file is responsible for encoding a given bit string.



## Correction + Decoding

The receiver.py file is responsible for encoding a given bit string.
